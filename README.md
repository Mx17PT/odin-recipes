# odin-recipes

This is my first project through my journey of completeing The Odin Project, It's a very simple example of a recipe webpage that is built using HTML only.

The project trys to demonstarte the foundational skills of HTML that I learn through stydying the Odin Project curriculum until now.

Always remember : "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step".
